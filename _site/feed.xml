Over the past few years, I’ve worked on AI-powered defect detection, predictive maintenance with IoT sensors, and 3D printing projects. 
I enjoy rolling up my sleeves to solve real problems—whether that’s fixing a faulty microcontroller, applying computer vision to improve a welding line, or automating an assembly process. Every challenge is an opportunity to innovate.
Feel free to explore my projects or reach out if you’d like to collaborate!</subtitle></feed>
