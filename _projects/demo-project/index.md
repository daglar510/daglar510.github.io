title: "13B Rotary Engine Design (University Project)"
description: >-
  In January 2024, as part of my university project, I designed and engineered a 13B Rotary Engine.
  The project involved designing and integrating core components—including the Rotor, Eccentric Shaft, Internal Gear,
  Stationary Gear, Side Housing, and Rotor Housing—using SolidWorks CAD software.
  I created detailed technical drawings and assembly blueprints to guide manufacturing and assembly processes, applying
  mechanical engineering principles to enhance engine performance.
  Collaborative efforts with a multidisciplinary team helped refine the design and address technical challenges.
  This project showcased my proficiency in CAD modeling, technical documentation, and problem-solving.
